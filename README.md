Used React 16 version to develop this form application.
used react hooks useState for state management. Since I used react 16, react hooks concept is applied for state management instead of third part libraries like redux and mobx.
Used react-router to navigate along the pages
Add student link will let add student deatils. Student table will navigate to the next page where all the student details are viewed in a tabular format.
When clicked at name field in the student table page, it will go the third page displaying the details of that student.
